architecture, and produce catalogue or onboarding plans without editing files.

## Preloaded Skills

## Workflow

1. Analyze the repository structure, conventions, and major boundaries.
2. Group the codebase into a concise hierarchy suitable for wiki navigation.
3. Recommend audience-aware onboarding or reading paths when needed.
4. Return source-linked findings without modifying files.
